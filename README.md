# SVG LogoMotion

## Description
Need to generate a quick logo as a placemarker for a project, wireframe, or something similar? LogoMotion has got you covered. This CLI functional node app will produce an image with 3 letters and a choice of 3 shapes, with any color you could find on a hex-color scale. You can also just type in a standard color.
Create simple SVG logos, automated, and fast!



## Examples


## Installation
Run on Node.js
there are dependencies that you can find in the package.json folder, and download with "npm install". 
Uses Inquirer for the question and answers, and Jest for the test. 

## Usage

when "logo.svg" pops up on the left side menu, right click it and select "live server" near the top of that menu. 
It should automatically pull up on your default browser.
