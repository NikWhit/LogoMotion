Need to generate a quick logo as a placemarker for a project, wireframe, or something similar? LogoMotion has got you covered. This CLI functional node app will produce an image with 3 letters and a choice of 3 shapes, with any color you could find on a hex-color scale. You can also just type in a standard color.
